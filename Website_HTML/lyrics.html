        No Man's Land
        Yet still on the body of the wall
        Many torn colour, Washed up men
        Professional vengeance is your consciousness'
        All the vibrant colourful lights
        Suddenly blue like the sky
        A dear face of yours drowned in it
        Coming so close, Eye to eye, Why break the path
 
        Two maps drawn, Between two lands
        Dissected feelings are still pierced in between
 
        But yet here is cool breeze
        Getting through closed windows
        Midnight grows clutching the wall
        Fear gathers in your shadow
        My adamant grit finds the light
        The cowardice is still there, But alone in dark
 
        The paths drift away surrounding you
        The lone home hangs from the barbed wire at night
        Two maps drawn, Between two lands
        Dissected feelings are still mixed in between
 
        Yet in these two barbed wires, Like in the city
        Crowds fill my sleep
        Unconscious and unclaimed, Coming close to the ground
        Knelt down thinking time was an epitaph
