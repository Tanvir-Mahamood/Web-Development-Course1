# Web Development Practice Files Repository
# Overview
This repository contains various web development practice files that I've created using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **PHP**, and **SQL**. These files are designed to document my learning progress and the coding exercises I've completed through self-study via YouTube tutorials. The code is organized and documented for easy reference and continued practice.

## Contents
- HTML Practice: Basic to advanced web page structures and layouts.
- CSS Practice: Styling and responsive designs using CSS3.
- JavaScript Practice: Interactive and dynamic web elements.
- PHP Practice: Server-side scripting and form handling.
- SQL Practice: Database management and integration with web applications.

## Resources
I have included helpful resources and references for each practice file to assist others in their learning journey. You can find links to tutorials, documentation, and other relevant materials in each file folder.
